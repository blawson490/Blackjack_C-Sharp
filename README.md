## Welcome to the BlackJack Game!

This project is a fun, console-based Blackjack game, built with C#. It's made up of two main parts: the game itself and a class library that powers the game.

### Components

#### 1. The BlackJack Game

This is the heart of the project - the game itself! It's built on the .NET Framework version 4.7.2 and can run on any CPU. The main entry point of the application is the Program.cs file.

You can find it here: BlackJack Game/BlackJack Game/Program.cs (Lines 1 to 28)

#### 2. The BlackJack Class Library

This is the engine that powers the game. It provides all the necessary classes and methods. The main game project references this library.

You can find it here: BlackJack Class Library/BlackJack Class Library/BlackJack Class Library.csproj (Lines 1 to 20)

### Getting Started

To start playing, you'll need to build and run the BlackJack Game project. Once you've done that, you'll find the output executable in the bin\Debug directory of the project.

Check out the project file here: BlackJack Game/BlackJack Game/BlackJack Game.csproj (Lines 16 to 21)

### Testing

We've also included a test project, BlackjackHandTest, to ensure everything runs smoothly. It tests the functionality of the game.

### License

We use the MSTest framework for our tests, which is licensed under the MIT License.

### Wrapping Up

This project is a great showcase of C# programming, console applications, class libraries, and unit testing. It's a simple, yet comprehensive application built using .NET. We hope you enjoy playing!
